# Human Motion Capture
Collecting papers about human motion capture

:bowtie::star::fire::muscle: I will update each day and add more details about every paper :sunny::sunny::sunny:

`NOTE : Since motion capture is a field that has been studied for many years, I will collect the up to date papers first and then try to gather the old but classical one.`
